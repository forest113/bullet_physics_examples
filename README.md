A few modifications of the HelloWorld example that show some basic rigid body physics

btVelAcc is a simple simulation of a free-falling body. Positions, velocity and acceleration is printed for each frame.
Object_on_slope is a simulation of an object that falls and collides with a slope. the collision is detected after which the object begins rolling, gaining angular velocity.
